What do i want to do?
    - I want to create a series of classes (10), each one representing an ordered dataset for financial data
    collected on the web.
    - The data will be collected from a list of British finance websites (10).
    - Each class should at least have:
        ==== one method for getting the data (by basing on the most recent one).
        ==== one method to parse and put them in a more ordered structure (like a JSON file).
        ==== one method to upload them to a MongoDB online database.

The MongoDB database management should be separate from this automation scripts in order to avoid
confusion or mess with too many scripts in the same main project.
    - I think to put it in a separate folder or even a completely different main dir.

The project should also manage the download/upload of the data to/from a server.
Regarding this, the presence or less of a server is optional.
    - The app MUST use the Amazon Cloud Service: AWS. By using it, the user can choose if
    to use a server or not (serverless application).

    - I decided to use Scrapy Items to order my data once scraped.
    - The basic structure of a field should be this:
        - region: str = the region where the market is located.
        - market: str = the market name.
        - sign: char = the market sign (+/-).
        - values: dict = {
            = the values of the market with each one containing the respective key.
        }.
